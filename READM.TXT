Config file is obviously not checked in with GIT
To have your own config file:
create a folder called "config"
put config.yml inside it

Entries in config.yml should be as follows:


mysql:
  host: MYSQL_HOST
  user: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD

sqs:
  aws_access_key_id: YOU_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  aws_secret_access_key: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  region_name: YOUR_REGION_NAME
